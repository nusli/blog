Yep, I finally managed to finish creating this blog.
I built it all from scratch and although I didn't know any [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before, the most time-consuming part of this project was (as always) the responsive css. In the end I decided to create a separate sidebar, header and footer and show/hide them based on the width. Feel free to resize the browser window and have a look at it (messages about bugs you find are always appreciated) ;)

## About this blog
At the moment I'm starting to work on the [P1xt guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) for becoming a professional developer which also recommend blogging about what you learn.
This blog serves the purpose of helping to review and organise what I learned as Developer. I decided to give it a try and also hope that this will help me become a better writer, too. In addition to this blog I will also start to take notes about the things I learn from this day on.

So that's it about my introductory post and I hope you will have a look at the other ones, too. Maybe you'll learn something too ;)
